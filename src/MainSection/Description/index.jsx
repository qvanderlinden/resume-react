    I am a freelance software engineer specialized in full-stack web development.
    I am currently pursuing positions in Next.js fullstack development, backend-oriented projects, DevOps and data engineering. 
    I am also a mathematics enthusiast who loves solving challenging problems using algorithms and data manipulation.
    Lately, I've been feeling the urge to learn new things, that's why I'm exploring the Go, Rust and Mojo programming languages.
