    I am a freelance fullstack software engineer with a strong mathematics background and data science experience.
    I am currently targeting projects in Next.js fullstack development, more backend-focused, DevOps, and data engineering.
    I am also a mathematics enthusiast who loves solving challenging problems using algorithms and data processing.
    Lately, I've been feeling the urge to learn new things, that's why I'm exploring the Go, Rust and Mojo programming languages.
